This is a very simple website I will be building for Materiales Vallejo.

I will first start off by doing all the HTML/CSS. After that, I will slowly and gradually incorporate
JavaScript, Google Analytics, and any other animations and interactions that will make it better.
After that I will start to build a CMS to make everything dynamic to avoid reusing code and start
to learn how to program better.
