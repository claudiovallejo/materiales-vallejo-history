# Middleman Project: Development Check-ins
Development started @ 17:00 CDT on October 8th, 2016

### Day #1
- **Date**: October 8th, 2016 @ 19:40 CDT
- **Update**:
  - Initialized Middleman project
  - Created data models for Spanish content
  - Configured `tachyons.css` to include project style guide
  - Created `_menu.erb`
  - Created `main.erb`
  - Created`index.html.erb`
  - Added `logo.svg`
  - Fixed `policy.json` and `services.json` syntax errors.
  - Worked on `_menu.erb` and centered logo vertically and horizontally in `<nav>`
- **Notes**:
  - Started working with Vim... gave up (for the day). It was taking me a lot of time to edit simple things. After an hour and a half of struggling decided to use Atom instead. Tomorrow I'll give Vim another shot.
  - Took me about half an hour to setup project style guide in `tachyons.css`. There has to be a more efficient way of configuring `tachyons.css` classes...
  - Still need to figure out how to localize content. Should do next.
  - During my break I watched several Vim YouTube videos. Still struggling to navigate between files, but managed to make previous edits in Vim.
  - Struggled to center logo vertically and horizontally. What I was struggling with was in determining what classes to use (`.dt`, `.v-mid`) to achieve that. Googled around for a bit and inspected several Navigation components in the Tachyons Docs. Figured it out. Will finish building partial tomorow.

### Day #2
- **Date**: October 9th, 2016 @ 11:04 CDT
- **Update**:
  - Created responsive hero section in `index.html.erb`
  - Created mobile Products section in `index.html.erb`

  - Created `_contact.erb` and included in `index.html.erb`
  - Created `_footer.erb` and included in `main.erb`
  - Imported icons into `images/icons`
