# Materiales Vallejo — Website

## Introduction
Materiales Vallejo is a small business in [Matamoros, Tamaulipas](https://www.google.com.mx/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=matamoros%2C%20tamaulipas) that sells construction materials.

Materiales Vallejo was looking for a basic website to display
  + the products they sell
  + services they offer
  + and contact information

## Project Roles
This was the first web project I designed and developed from scratch and was my second freelance web design project. Before this project I had basic experience building websites with Webflow, Squarespace and Adobe Muse.

I'm responsible for everything about this website: photography, content, icon design, visual design (except logo), and front-end development.
