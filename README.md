# Materiales Vallejo — Website

## Introduction
Materiales Vallejo is a small business in [Matamoros, Tamaulipas](https://www.google.com.mx/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=matamoros%2C%20tamaulipas) that sells construction materials. You can view v2.0 of the site [here](http://materialesvallejo.com/).

Materiales Vallejo was looking for a basic website to display
  + the products they sell
  + services they offer
  + and contact information

This is the first web project I designed and developed from scratch. Before this project I had basic experience building websites with Webflow, Squarespace and Adobe Muse. I've learned a lot about web design and development through this project. I've been responsible for everything about this website: photography, content, icon design, visual design, and front-end development. It's a very small site, but it's been challenging and fun nonetheless. As of today I've designed and built two versions of the site and am currently working on building the third version. Below you can find more details about each version.
