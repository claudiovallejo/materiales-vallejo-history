# Features
## Dynamic Link Card Injection
  + This feature will offer users an additional, more natural way of navigating through the products
  + What is yet to be done for this feature is to create the styling or the card links and create the scripting necessary to include the card links in `#product-list`
## Smart Product List Selection
  + This feature unites the experience of interacting with the Image Gallery in `index.html` because it will show the appropriate Product Category depending on which Gallery Ad they clicked on
  + Some research will have to be done regarding the interaction between multiple `.js` files, updating the `products.js` script to dynamically render the initial loading function.
## Remove Background Images
  + Too many background images are being used, which negatively affect SEO
  + This feature will require the updating of image div ids, creation of appropriate alternative text for each image
## Image Pre-rendering
  + It doesn't give a good impression when the images are slowly loading
  + Research some methods to ensure that when the page is loaded the images are also loaded
