# Middleman Project: Development Check-ins
Development started @ 17:00 CDT on October 8th, 2016

### Check-in #1
- **Date**: October 8th, 2016 @ 19:40 CDT
- **Update**:
  - Initialized Middleman project
  - Created data models for Spanish content
  - Configured `tachyons.css` to include project style guide
  - Created `_menu.erb`
  - Created `main.erb`
  - Created`index.html.erb`
  - Added `logo.svg`
- **Notes**:
  - Started working with Vim... gave up (for the day). It was taking me a lot of time to edit simple things. After an hour and a half of struggling decided to use Atom instead. Tomorrow I'll give Vim another shot.
  - Took me about half an hour to setup project style guide in `tachyons.css`. There has to be a more efficient way of configuring `tachyons.css` classes...
  - Still need to figure out how to localize content. Should do next.
